<h1>EkStep Mobility</h1>
<h2>Building for Bilions</h2>
<p>The lack of access to learning opportunities is a complex and multidimensional problem.
    It impacts the lives of millions of children on a daily basis.
    In response, EkStep is building a collaborative platform to
    re-imagine learning opportunities for every child.</p>

<p>EkStep Mobility is building a platform where every child would have the learning application on their palm.
The mobility platform can be used not only in big cities where one would have fast internet connection
but also in remote village areas where internet connection is a luxury.</p>

<p>The mobility platform is built using the following principle to achieve the above target -</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Offlinity</h2>
        <p>The learning contents once downloaded, can be played anywhere anytime. These contents can alos be transfered from one device to another
        . It can also be downloaded from a CDN device, which acts as cloud to the remote areas where internet is inaccesable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Sideloading</h2>
        <p>Contents can be loaded into the application through an USB device and this fulfills
            the promise of providing the learning to the children of remote villages.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The mobile platform is built following the gold standard architecture, quality and process</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>TDD</h2>
        <p>Mobility team writes the test cases first, and then they write the code to satisfy those test cases. The EkStep Mobility team has a code coverage
        of 90%.</p>
    </li>
