<h2>The Amplifiers</h2>
<p>
    The EkStep engineering team takes pride in co-creation using OpenSource. The OpenSource ecosystem ensures that the impact of the individual is amplified by the power of the collective, while conributions from the collective extend and strengthen it. We believe that greater community participation leads to a more secure, robust and bug-free Sunbird - EkStep's opensource learning platform. We welcome contributions for ideation, development, testing, maintenance and documentation.
